# TicTacToe

This is an assignment from The Odin Projects' JavaScript path.

Project currently has functionality for Player vs Player and Player vs Computer.

In Player vs Player, Player 1 always goes first and uses 'X' as their token.

In Player vs Computer, the player always goes first and uses 'X' as their token.

In the future I might make it so the player who moves first is random, but for now it is fixed.

Planning to make a smarter AI and allow the user to choose between smart and dumb AI although this addition is not guaranteed.
