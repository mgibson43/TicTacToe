# TicTacToe

This is an assignment from The Odin Projects' JavaScript path.

First I'm uploading the project with player vs player functionality, but in the near future I would like to add functionality for player vs computer games.

Currently there is a bug with restarting the game that causes a win to be shown as undefined.
